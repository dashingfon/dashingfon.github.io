# My Portfolio

Full‑Stack Engineer by day, Web3 Security Sleuth by night. I build sleek, scalable apps (Python and Javascript), and I poke holes in blockchain systems before the bad guys do. Whether I’m coding a clean microservice or auditing smart contracts for vulnerabilities, I’m fueled by curiosity, clean code—and the occasional strong ☕.
