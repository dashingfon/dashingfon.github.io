# My Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my portfolio

Full‑Stack Engineer by day, Web3 Security Sleuth by night. I build sleek, scalable apps (React ↔️ Node ↔️ PostgreSQL), and I poke holes in blockchain systems before the bad guys do. Whether I’m coding a clean microservice or auditing smart contracts for vulnerabilities, I’m fueled by curiosity, clean code—and the occasional strong ☕.
